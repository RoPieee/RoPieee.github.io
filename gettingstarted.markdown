Getting started with RoPieee is just a matter of downloading an image, write it to a Micro SD card and insert that into a Raspberry Pi. About 15 minutes later you're ready to go!
Downloads for RoPieee, as well as extensive documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee)

That's also the place where you can report issues, if you run into a problem. 
Furthermore you can interact with a large group of users on the [Roon community Forum](https://community.roonlabs.com/c/audio-gear-talk/ropieee/56)
