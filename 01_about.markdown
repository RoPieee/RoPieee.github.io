RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (3, 4 and 5 family) that is capable of running several audio streaming platforms. RoPieee can be seen as an appliance, and as such requires no computer knowledge whatsoever. RoPieee's functionality is often called a 'network bridge'.

RoPieee is free for usage and runs purely on spare time, coffee and happy users. 
Of course [donations](/donate) are welcome :wink:
