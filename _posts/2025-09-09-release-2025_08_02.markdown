With 2025.08.1 Squeezelite discovery stopped functioning. After a week of digging I finally figured out it was a Linux kernel bug (very recent regression) that plagued us, so this release addresses that.

It also made me rethink RoPieee’s kernel upgrade policy - let’s make it a little bit more conservative. This incident made it clear that even a stable Linux LTS release can present unexpected challenges ☺️

For existing RoPieee users, this update will be available on your devices within a few hours. New users can simply download the latest image from [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/releases/2025_08_2.md) to get started quickly.

Enjoy!
