I’m excited to announce our first release of 2026! It has been some time since the last one.

This is a significant release, largely due to the effort involved in supporting the 5-inch variant of the official 'Display 2'. While the initial support was straightforward, a major issue was encountered with its implementation specifically on the Raspberry Pi 3.

The migration to a 64-bit operating system for the Pi 3 family, a significant undertaking, was necessitated by issues encountered while implementing the 5-inch display. Previously, RoPieee ran in 32-bit mode on the Pi 3, while Pi 4 and 5 were already 64-bit. This upgrade proved beneficial, as it not only resolved the display issues, allowing us to now support the 5-inch display across all Pi variants, but also resulted in performance gains for the Pi 3.

In addition to the new 'Display 2' support, this release includes updated components and resolved bugs.

Existing RoPieee users will automatically receive this update on their devices. The latest image for new users can be downloaded directly from [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/releases/2026_01.md).
