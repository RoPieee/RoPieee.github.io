Unfortunately Spotify changed something on their end (again), which resulted in [failure](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/issues/26) when trying to play something. This patch release addresses that. 

This update will be automatically available to existing RoPieee users on their devices. New users can simply download the latest image from [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/releases/2025_10_2.md) to get started quickly.

For the changelog, images, and documentation, visit [RoPieee's GitHub page](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee).

Enjoy!
