Unfortunately there slipped a regression in 2025.06, so this release is here to fix that.
With 2025.06 we got support for more than 1 USB DAC as possible output device for services like Spotify, but unfortunately that caused a failure on units equipped with a HAT that has it's own mixer.

That's now sorted out, and while fixing that we sneaked in a few other goodies:

* update HQPlayer NAA component
* update Linux kernel
* some UI polish to the Network tab

As always you can get the latest version and more information [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md)

Enjoy!
