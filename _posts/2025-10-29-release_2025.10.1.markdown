The 2025.10 update regrettably introduced a regression in UPnP functionality when used with DSD content. This was unexpected, as no apparent changes were made to UPnP. However, subsequent investigation identified an updated library as the underlying cause.

This beta release includes a fix for this [issue](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/issues/23). If sufficient user feedback confirms the resolution, a formal release will follow as soon as possible.

Existing RoPieee beta users will automatically receive this update.

Thanks!
