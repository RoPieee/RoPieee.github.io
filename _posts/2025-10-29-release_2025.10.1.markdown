The 2025.10 update regrettably introduced a regression in UPnP functionality when used with DSD content. This was unexpected, as no apparent changes were made to UPnP. However, subsequent investigation identified an updated library as the underlying cause.

This release includes a fix for this [issue](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/issues/23).

This update will be automatically available to existing RoPieee users on their devices. New users can simply download the latest image from [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/releases/2025_10_1.md) to get started quickly.

Enjoy!
