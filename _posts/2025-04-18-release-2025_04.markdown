Hi all,

It took longer than anticipated, but here’s a new RoPieee release!

This one is largely focused on supporting the new ‘Display 2’ official Raspberry Pi touchscreen, but some nice other goodies are also included.

As usual you can find the complete changelog and downloads over [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md)

Enjoy!
