During the 2025.08 beta cycle, we encountered an MMC failure issue on a single user's Pi 3 during boot. Despite affecting only one user, significant time was dedicated to debugging, though I couldn't reproduce it myself. The reporting user's assistance with additional testing was invaluable. 

Thanks to RoPieee's defensive measures against file system issues, which were developed in response to MMC failures, the problem was not critical. A simple reboot restored normal operation. Ultimately, we decided the issue wasn't critical enough to delay the release.

The problem resurfaced after the 2025.08 release, a predictable yet extremely frustrating occurrence ðŸ™‚ Further debugging resulted in a solution, so this RoPieee patch release is mainly about fixing this issue. And while at it, I fixed a few other bugs as well.
