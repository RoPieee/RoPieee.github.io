New Year, new RoPieee release! 💥 🍻

This release has changes all over the place. Most prominent one is the work on the display, where support for Roon’s volume limits has been implemented.

The other change that stands out is the ‘survive hostname change’. The ‘hostname’ was still a rather technical computer term, so that has been changed to ‘device name’. And furthermore the webpage will ‘survive’ a hostname/device name change, because it navigates to a URL that is indepedant of the hostname.

For most this is trivial, but I often got questions from first-time users that run into the issue that they don’t realize they need to navigate to the `new_hostname.local` address.

So, I’m pretty happy with this release; I hope you will be too :wink:

You can find the complete changelog and downloads over [here](https://github.com/RoPieee/RoPieee/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md)

Enjoy!
